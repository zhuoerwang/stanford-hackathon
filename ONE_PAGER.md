# TrialMatch

**Voice AI That Connects Cancer Patients to Life-Saving Clinical Trials**

## The Problem

> **85% of cancer patients don't know clinical trials are an option. 75% would have enrolled if someone told them.**

**Doctors can't help.** 15-minute appointments, no incentive to refer—oncologists focus on standard treatment, not trial discovery.

**Websites are unusable.** ClinicalTrials.gov has 400,000+ trials, but patients must parse medical jargon and 30+ eligibility criteria. A cancer patient—exhausted, scared, unfamiliar with clinical terms—cannot navigate this alone.

**Phone calls don't scale.** Coordinators are overwhelmed with unqualified callers. Patients don't know what to ask. Each failed screen costs $1,200.

**The result:** 80% of trials fail enrollment timelines, costing $8M/day—while patients who could benefit never learn trials exist.

## Our Solution: Voice-First Trial Matching

**TrialMatch** is an AI voice agent that matches patients to trials through conversation—no forms, no jargon, no navigation.

Patients talk to "Sarah," an empathetic AI who:
- **Listens** — Gathers medical info through supportive dialogue
- **Searches** — Queries 400K+ trials via ClinicalTrials.gov MCP
- **Explains** — Translates eligibility criteria into plain language
- **Matches** — Surfaces trials by condition and location

**Why voice?** Patients are too weak to type, too overwhelmed to read. Voice meets them where they are—accessible, intuitive, human.
